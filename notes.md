## Notes to self...
* Stats section doesn't really teach anything except how to do statistical operations.
  - Could incorporate nest, map, broom functions and workflow
  - Only section with `stuff[["X"]]`

* Example kind of sucks
  - Would be nice to have an example with more of an effect
  - Adding another example or two could be an effective way of reinforcing how to transition back and forth between datasets

* Could do a better job of reinforcing reproducible data practices.
  - Have people put code into a dedicated R script from the start
  - Create directory structure from the beginning
  - Comment code

* Missing things...
  - Faceting
  - Rmd documents
  - Integration with git?
  - Style

* How "minimal" is what I'm presenting?
  - Tradeoff between reality and minimum

* Should be easyish to convert to bookdown?

## Deconstruct ordinations
